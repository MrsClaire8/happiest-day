# happiest-day
Data analysis that gives information about the happiest day of the week based on the ratings of courses and times of ratings.

The analysis' aim was to practice preparing and visualizing the data. 

The data comes from "The Python Mega Course by Ardit Sulce"

Based on the users' reviews on udemy.com I concluded about the happiest day of the week. The assumption was that people give better reviews when they have a good day. So the happiest day is the day with the highest average of the ratings.
